                <p>Dear Hiring Manager,
                    My name is Alex Rowland, and I am submitting my application for the Junior
                    WordPress / Front-End Developer position at Ideatree. I am a Full Stack Web
                    Developer working primarily in the MERN Stack, and also hold degrees in
                    Economics and Music from Wesleyan University.
                    I recently created a web application that checks current surfing conditions along the
                    California coast. The application allows users search for nearby spots based off any
                    address within 30 miles of the coast, and to leave comments about each spot they
                    visit. Since then, I have been building a social network application using MongoDB,
                    Express, React, Redux, and Node.
                    In a past life, I spent time working in the music industry, both as an artist and as a
                    businessman. Having worked with various artists throughout my career, I
                    understand how to bring an idea to life from nothing, and how to collaborate. Since
                    becoming a software engineer, I have found these skills to be useful. As a Front End
                    Developer at Ideatree I will bring a hard work ethic, a love for creativity, and an
                    excitement to learn.
                    I look forward to hearing from you soon.
                    Best,
                    Alex
