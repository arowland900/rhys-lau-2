                <p id="leftP">Dear Hiring Manager,
                    My name is Alex Rowland, and I am submitting my application for the Junior
                    WordPress / Front-End Developer position at Ideatree. I am a Full Stack Web
                    Developer working primarily in the MERN Stack, and also hold degrees in
                    Economics and Music from Wesleyan University.
                    I recently created a web application that checks current surfing conditions along the
                    California coast. The application allows users search for nearby spots based off any
                    address within 30 miles of the coast, and to leave comments about each spot they
                    visit. Since then, I have been building a social network application using MongoDB,
                    Express, React, Redux, and Node.
                    <!-- In a past life, I spent time working in the music industry, both as an artist and as a
                    businessman. Having worked with various artists throughout my career, I
                    understand how to bring an idea to life from nothing, and how to collaborate. Since
                    becoming a software engineer, I have found these skills to be useful. As a Front End
                    Developer at Ideatree I will bring a hard work ethic, a love for creativity, and an
                    excitement to learn.
                    I look forward to hearing from you soon.
                    Best,
                    Alex

                    <p style="text-align: left;">My name is Alexander Rowland, and I am submitting my application for
                        the Junior Software Engineer position at Clutter.&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke recently with David
                        Feinerman and let him know that I would be applying.&nbsp;&nbsp;((add specific clutter interest
                        info here))</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">I am a Full Stack Software Engineer working primarily in the MERN
                        Stack, and am excited to work with more languages and technologies as my career
                        advances.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, I am co-teaching an immersive web development program at General
                        Assembly, a program which I attended earlier this year. As a teacher, it is my job to explain a
                        variety of programming topics such that both the strongest and weakest students in class can
                        understand the material.&nbsp;&nbsp;I particularly enjoy watching my students tackle problems in
                        their own unique ways with the tools we have learned.</p>
